ddpy
===================
Rather than mere [data-driven rhythms](https://github.com/csv/ddr),
this is data-driven music in python.

More precisely, ddpy serializes tables in python to midi files and
deserializes midi files to tables. It provides a `to_midi` function
and a `from_midi` function.

We plan on adding `to_midi` and `from_midi` as `pandas.DataFrame`
methods eventually.
