Data music for big data analysis
=====

## Introduction
Visualization can only support so many variables.
In order to study high-dimensional datasets,
we need to leverage more senses, like the sense of sound.

### History of ddpy
[csv soundsystem](http://csvsoundsystem.com) makes
music from data, and we have developed a few tools
to help us do that. We started out by with disgusting
hacks in R, which we eventually abstracted into a
package called
[data-driven rhythms (ddr)](https://github.com/csv/ddr).
dd**py** is confusingly named after the package dd**r**,
even though there's no pun anymore.
The API for ddpy is inspired largely by a prototype
we build for making music
[from Google Spreadsheets](https://github.com/csv/sheetmusic).

### Today
Today, you'll learn how to transform a dataset into music.
We'll use the `ddpy` package for this tutorial, but the
same concepts apply to other libraries.

## Dependencies
You'll need a means of playing MIDI files.
[timidity++]() is one option.


You'll also need [ddpy]().

    pip install ddpy
